1. When i log in i need to do either one of these two things to see any content-:
    i, I need to refresh the home page
    ii, I need to go to another page from home page

2. When i create a post then i get redirected to the see post page but after that if i click on the my posts page then it says
   that Id is undefined but when i refresh then it works finely.
